      Hi there ðŸ‘‹
      <br />
      Despite of my real name people call me "Dresha". I'm an experienced
      software engineer with more than 11 years of building outstanding products
      ðŸ¦„. Most of my career I was focusing on the frontend side of web
      applications, but I also have extensive experience in backend development
      and DevOps. I'm a strong team player and leader. I enjoy working with
      others to solve complex problems and motivate them to build innovative
      solutions. I'm a lifelong learner and I'm always looking for new
      opportunities to grow and develop myself and the team. In my free time I'm
      enjoying to read books, to play board games, to travel, to hike, to roller
      skate, to do yoga and to play basketball. I'm currently interested in
      working remotely with React/Svelte frameworks on the frontend side and
      Node.js, NestJs on the backend side.
