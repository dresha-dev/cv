      Hi there ðŸ‘‹
      <br />
      Despite my real name people call me "Dresha". I'm a software engineer with
      more than 11 years of professional development and outstanding products
      ðŸ¦„. For most of my career, I was focusing on building the frontend side of
      web applications, but I also have experience in backend development and
      DevOps. I'm also a strong team player and I enjoy working with others to
      solve complex problems and build innovative solutions. I'm a lifelong
      learner and I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow and develop
      my skills. In my free time, I'm interested in reading books, playing board
      games, traveling, hiking, roller skating, yoga, and basketball. I'm
      currently interested in working remotely with Reactor Svelte frameworks on
      the front end side and Node.js, NestJs on the backend side.
